## Current Functionality

Blue Leopards is a reimplementation of the functionality of [Bowfolios](https://bowfolios.github.io) for mobile devices. Work has currently been done on the frontend using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) for component-based UI design and [React Native Paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/) for production-ready components.
